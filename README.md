## Why Switch to Linux?

### Common Reasons Users Leave Windows:

- **End of Support:** Windows 10 support ends October 2025, forcing expensive upgrades or hardware replacement
- **Privacy Concerns:** Telemetry, forced updates, and data collection
- **Performance:** Linux runs faster on older hardware
- **Cost:** Completely free, no license fees
- **Control:** You own your system, not Microsoft
- **Security:** Better protection against malware and viruses
- **Customization:** Make your system look and work exactly how you want
- **No Forced Updates:** Update on your schedule, not Microsoft's
