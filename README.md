## Why Switch to Linux?

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### End of Support
Windows 10 support ends October 2025, forcing expensive upgrades or hardware replacement. Linux runs on any hardware, forever.

### Privacy Concerns
No more telemetry, forced updates, and data collection. Your computer, your rules.

### Performance
Linux runs significantly faster on older hardware. Breathe new life into aging machines.

</td>
<td width="50%">

### Zero Cost
Completely free, no license fees, no subscriptions, no hidden costs. Ever.

### Full Control
You own your system, not Microsoft. Customize everything exactly how you want.

### Built-in Security
Superior protection against malware and viruses. Antivirus rarely needed for personal use.

## Getting Started

### Choosing the Right Distribution

The "best" Linux distribution depends entirely on your needs. We've created a detailed guide to help you choose based on your intended use case.

**[See our complete guide to choosing the right distro →](./docs/choosing-a-distro/README.md)**

---

## Installation Guide

### Step 1: Create a Bootable USB

#### On Windows:
1. Download [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/)
2. Insert USB drive (8GB or larger)
3. Open Rufus and select your downloaded Linux ISO file
4. Click "Start"

#### On Linux:
```bash
# Using dd command (replace /dev/sdX with your USB drive)
sudo dd if=linux-distro.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress
```

### Step 2: Backup Your Data

> **CRITICAL:** Before installing Linux, backup all important files from Windows.

**Recommended backup locations:**
- External hard drive
- Cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive)
- Secondary internal drive

### Step 3: Installation Process

1. **Boot from USB**
   - Restart computer
   - Press F12, F2, or Del during boot (varies by manufacturer)
   - Select USB drive from boot menu

2. **Choose Installation Type**
   - **Replace Windows:** Erases Windows completely (recommended for dedicated Linux users)
   - **Dual Boot:** Keep Windows alongside Linux (good for testing)
   - **Something Else:** Manual partitioning (advanced users)

3. **Follow the Installer**
   - Select language
   - Configure keyboard layout
   - Create user account
   - Wait for installation (15-30 minutes)

4. **Reboot and Enjoy**

## File System Differences

### Windows vs Linux Paths

| Concept | Windows | Linux |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Root | `C:\` | `/` |
| User folder | `C:\Users\username\` | `/home/username/` or `~` |
| Program files | `C:\Program Files\` | `/usr/bin/`, `/opt/` |
| System files | `C:\Windows\` | `/etc/`, `/boot/` |
| Path separator | `\` (backslash) | `/` (forward slash) |
| Documents | `C:\Users\username\Documents` | `~/Documents` |
| Downloads | `C:\Users\username\Downloads` | `~/Downloads` |

### Common Linux Directories

- `/home` — User home directories (like `C:\Users`)
- `/etc` — System configuration files
- `/usr` — User programs and data
- `/var` — Variable data (logs, caches)
- `/tmp` — Temporary files (cleared on reboot)
- `/opt` — Optional software
- `/mnt` — Mount points for drives
